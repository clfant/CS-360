# CS-360 Project

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
For this project, I was to create an application to hosue an inventory. The requirements was to have a login screen, inventory screen and a screen to approve sms notifications. Each of these have their own features but are the main screens.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
For the login screen, we needed a username and passsword section to enter and a button to login. Upon clicking the button if the user exist then you would be logged in. If the user did not exist, then they would be created in the database. 
For the inventory screen, it shows the inventory in a grid view and has buttons to add, delete and edit the inventory. 
The sms permissions screen shows a message and a button to accept messages. If accepted then you are sent messages, if not then the app continues.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I developed this a screen at a time. I started with the login screen, then the inventory screen and finally the sms screen. I took this approach because it allowed me to break it apart and develop and test easier.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I tested this by developing a section and ensuring it worked before moving on. This is important because you need to know the basic stuff works before adding on more complicated items. This also helps towards the end and knowing this works you can knowing the users won't have any issues.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
Creating the databases was interesting. I had to get creative when developing and integrating SQL and the databases. One for the users and one for the inventory. Working around this took some work but eventually overcame it.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
Creating the functions was easy for me. A lot of these were simple and I have had plenty of experience doing these functions.
